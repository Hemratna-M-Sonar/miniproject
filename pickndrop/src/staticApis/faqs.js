Valohai isn’t a data science platform; it&#x27;s a Machine Learning Management Platform that handles the whole ML pipeline from feature extraction, to training of your model and to deploying it into production in a reproducible manner. Data science platforms offer hosted notebooks and AutoML solutions."

        'ans' : "Depends. Most of our customers use their own cloud and thus pay for usage according to their own agreements. Valohai doesn&#x27;t charge anything on top of the per-user license fee. If you don&#x27;t have a cloud provider, you can use our AWS, GCP and Azure accounts, and we&#x27;ll only charge you for what you use."
